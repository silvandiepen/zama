# Development Best Practices

## Code Organization

- Feature-based structure: Group related files together
- Consistent naming: Use descriptive, conventional names
- Separation of concerns: Clear boundaries between UI, logic, and data
- Barrel exports: Clean import paths with index files

## Component Design Patterns

### Composition over Inheritance

Build complex UIs by composing simple components:

```
// Good: Composition
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <Title>Dashboard</Title>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardBody>
    <Charts />
  </CardBody>
</Card>
```

### Props Drilling Prevention

Use Context API to avoid props drilling:

- Theme context for styling
- Auth context for user data
- Locale context for internationalization

## Performance Optimization

### React Patterns

- useMemo: Expensive calculations
- useCallback: Function references
- React.memo: Component memoization
- Code splitting: Lazy loading components

### Bundle Optimization

- Tree shaking for unused code
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- Image optimization
- Font loading strategies

## Accessibility (a11y)

Build inclusive applications for all users:

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

## Security Considerations

- Input validation: Sanitize all user inputs
- XSS prevention: Proper data escaping
- CSRF protection: Token-based validation
- Secure storage: Avoid sensitive data in localStorage
